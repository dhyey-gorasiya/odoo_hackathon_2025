## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Expense Flow

```
Employee creates $100 taxi expense
    â†“
Manager reviews and approves
    â†“
Finance reviews and approves
    â†“
Expense marked approved, currency converted
```

**Try it:**
1. Login as employee
2. Create expense
3. Logout, login as manager
4. Approve expense
5. Logout, login as admin/finance
6. Approve again
7. Check expense status (approved!)

### Scenario 2: Manager Approver Flag

```
Employee has "manager approver" enabled
    â†“
Expense goes to direct manager FIRST
    â†“
Then follows normal approval sequence
```

**Try it:**
1. Login as admin
2. Edit employee, set manager and enable "Is Manager Approver"
3. Login as employee, submit expense
4. Expense now requires manager approval before others

### Scenario 3: Specific Approver Rule

```
CFO is set as specific approver
    â†“
When CFO approves, expense auto-approved
    â†“
Other approvers bypassed
```

**Try it:**
1. Create rule type "Specific"
2. Select CFO user as specific approver
3. Activate rule
4. Submit expense as employee
5. Login as CFO, approve
6. Expense immediately approved!

## Troubleshooting

**Can't login?**
- Check email/password
- Use Cookie Inspector â†’ Seed Demo Data
- Or signup new account

**Expenses not showing?**
- Employees only see their own expenses
- Admins/managers see all expenses
- Check status filter (try "All Status")

**Currency conversion not working?**
- Check internet connection (needs exchange rate API)
- May use cached rates (12-hour expiry)
- Fallback to 1:1 if API fails

**Changes not persisting?**
- Data stored in cookies - check cookies enabled
- Don't use incognito/private mode
- Cookie Inspector shows all stored data

**Build errors?**
- Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
- Run `npm install` again
- Try `npm run typecheck` to see errors

## Development
